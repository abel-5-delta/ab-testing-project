# A/B Testing Simulation Project

## 📊 Overview
This project demonstrates A/B testing concepts through simulation, showing how sample size affects our ability to detect real effects in experiments.

## 🔬 Key Findings
- **With n=1,000 per group:** Could not detect a true 3% difference (p=0.61)
- **With n=10,000 per group:** Successfully detected the effect (p<0.0001)
- **Conclusion:** Sample size dramatically impacts statistical power

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Statistical hypothesis testing (two-proportion z-test)

##  Files
- `AB_Testing_Project.ipynb`: Complete simulation notebook

##  What I Learned
- The Law of Large Numbers in practice
- Relationship between sample size and significance
- Proper A/B test design and interpretation
